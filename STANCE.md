# MAGIACTE — Stance & Mana Philosophy

---

## 1. Core Design Intent

MAGIACTE avoids fixed elemental advantage systems.

There is:
- No hard counter triangle
- No pre-match deterministic loss
- No hidden comeback multipliers

Instead, the game centers on:

> Mana circulation control

Victory emerges from flow dominance, not attribute superiority.

---

## 2. Stance System (Pre-Match Declaration)

Players select a Stance before each match.

Stances are:
- Publicly visible before the match begins
- Light numerical modifiers (minor efficiency bias)
- Freely changeable between matches
- Non-locking (no progression cost)

Stance represents declared philosophical intent, not class identity.

---

## 3. Stance List

### 🜄 Circulation Dominion (Midrange / Default Philosophy)
Focus: Balanced mana flow and field control
- Slight bonus to siphon efficiency
- Slight bonus when maintaining field advantage

This is the conceptual baseline of MAGIACTE.

---

### 🜆 Efficiency Compression (Aggro)
Focus: Short-cycle tempo and cost compression
- Slight bonus to low-cost spell efficiency
- Slight bonus to early-cycle pressure

Strong in tempo bursts, weaker in long flow wars.

---

### 🜃 Future Scatter (Control)
Focus: Investing into opponent field for delayed gain
- Slight bonus to scatter magnitude
- Increased payoff from future field imbalance

Relies on patience and macro awareness.

---

### 🜅 Precision Interference (Advanced)
Focus: Differential mastery and perfect timing
- Slight bonus on near-perfect or perfect interference
- Enhanced reward from narrow differential control

Requires strong system understanding.

---

### 🜇 Structural Devotion (Research / High Complexity)
Focus: High-structure spell execution
- Slight scaling bonus from complex spell structures
- Minor amplification when Parts interact coherently

High skill ceiling, high expressive potential.

---

## 4. Stance Philosophy

Stances:
- Do not create automatic win/loss matchups
- Create slopes, not walls
- Modify amplification, not base power

Bonuses are conditional and situational.

A stance alone cannot win a match.
It becomes meaningful only when aligned with:
- Field mana state
- Era conditions
- Spell structure
- Player decision-making

---

## 5. Resonance Model

Stance effects amplify when aligned with environment.

| Stance | Aligned Condition | Effect |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Circulation Dominion | Field Advantage | Amplified siphon gain |
| Future Scatter | High Field Variance | Strong delayed payoff |
| Precision Interference | Balanced Mana State | Enhanced differential bonus |
| Efficiency Compression | Early cycles | Tempo burst amplification |
| Structural Devotion | Coherent Parts interaction | Compounding structure bonus |

Resonance is situational, not permanent.

---

## 6. Respectful Defeat Principle

Losses must be explainable.

A player should be able to say:

- "They controlled the mana flow better."
- "They exploited field imbalance more efficiently."
- "Their stance aligned better with the current state."

There are no random reversals.
There are no hidden systemic rescues.

All advantage emerges from visible interaction.

---

## 7. Identity Without Lock-In

Stances are:
- Declarative
- Lightweight
- Reversible

Attachment comes from playstyle expression, not progression locking.

Players are not bound to a class.
They declare intention each match.

Over time, identity forms through behavior patterns, not restrictions.

---

## 8. Design Summary

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Core axis | Mana circulation control |
| Stance nature | Philosophical bias, not class |
| Counter system | No elemental hard counters |
| Pre-match outcome | No deterministic loss |
| Advantage source | Resonance with field and Era |
| Defeat quality | Respectable and intelligible |

MAGIACTE is a contest of flow, structure, and alignment — not attribute advantage.
