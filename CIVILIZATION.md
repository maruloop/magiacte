# MAGIACTE — Meta & Civilization Layer Design

---

# 1. Casting Systems & Cost Ceilings

Each spell handling system has a maximum cost ceiling.

| System         | Cost Ceiling | Role                               |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 🃏 Arcana      | Small        | Instant activation, compact format |
| 📖 Grimoire    | Medium       | Structured and stable              |
| ✍️ Sigil       | Medium       | Drawing-based creation             |
| 🎙 Chant       | Medium–High  | Skill-based compression            |
| 🪄 Rod         | Unlimited    | Creation and research              |

Only Rod has no inherent upper cost limit.

# 2. Rod as Weapon Smith

Rod is not a competitive dominance class.

Rod represents:

* Spell inventor
* Structure designer
* Civilization pioneer

Rod players create new spells that may later enter civilization.

---

# 3. Spell Lifecycle

## Stage 1 — TheOrigin

* Created via Rod
* Usable only by creator

## Stage 2 — Replica

* Tradable via marketplace
* Usable by buyers

## Stage 3 — Common (World Imprinted)

* Becomes part of world system
* Usable by all casting systems (within ceiling limits)

Performance remains identical across stages.
Differences are cosmetic (effects, creator tag, historical marker).

---

# 4. Marketplace & Imprint System

Rod-created spells may be traded.

When widely used in competitive play:

* The system extracts structural components
* The spell becomes world-imprinted

World imprint enables:

* Cross-system usage
* Structural standardization

---

# 5. Modular Spell Abstraction (Parts System)

Spells are composed of abstract Parts.

Example conceptual categories:

* Core structure
* Modifier
* Trigger
* Propagation pattern

When a spell becomes imprinted:

* Its reusable Parts are abstracted
* Parts become combinable by others

If a Rod spell exceeds other systems' ceilings:

* It is decomposed into Parts
* Other systems may use compatible subsets

This enables generalization without full power transfer.

---

# 6. Era System

Era represents a global environmental state controlled by the Game Master.

Characteristics:

* Limited duration
* Announced in advance
* Modifies casting efficiency, cost, or interference behavior

Era reshapes the macro meta environment.

---

# 7. Erosion (Forgetting System)

Spells degrade over time across Eras.

Example progression:

Active Spell
→ Fading Spell (Cost +1 or minor stability loss)
→ Forgotten Spell (Further cost increase or restrictions)

After multiple Eras (e.g., three), a spell may become unusable outside reconstruction.

Rod may reconstruct forgotten spells from structural memory.

Erosion prevents permanent dominance while preserving historical continuity.

---

# 8. Meta Evolution Model

1. Rod invents spell (TheOrigin)
2. Spell spreads via marketplace (Replica)
3. Competitive usage increases
4. Parts are abstracted
5. Spell becomes Common (world-imprinted)
6. Era shifts reshape efficiency
7. Spell erodes over time
8. Rod pioneers new structures

MAGIACTE operates as a living magical civilization driven by invention, abstraction, and forgetting.
